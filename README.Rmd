# craigr: an R package to get data from craigslist

The purpose of this package is to obtain data from any section of
craigslist and load it into a clean `data.frame` within R.  Currently this only
works with apartment searches.  See the "Package status" below.

## Install

`devtools::install_github("adletaw/craigr")`

## Package status

This package is under active develpment.  Currently, you can download housing
rental data only.

## Usage

### Finding available rentals

*craigr* will do an apartment search using the function `rentals`.  You can
supply almost any search parameters that are available on craiglist.  See the
help page for `rentals` to get the full parameter list.

First you have to specify the location and area.  The location works as the 
Craigslist subdomain, e.g. [seattle.craigslist.org](https://seattle.craigslist.org). 
The area allows you to filter to a more specific location according to the
pre-programmed three-letter codes in Craigslist.  For example, using `see`
limits the search to the Seattle city limits only.  The default is `all`.

```{r location, message = FALSE}
results <- craigr::rentals(location = "seattle", area = "see", 
                           max_results = 100)

head(results)
```

The listing title, price, data and url are provided.  Check [craigslist](https://craigslist.org)
to find the location subdomain and three-letter area code.
